### Current status:

We have been able to implement all of the main aspects of our `Detailed View` screen. However we have not been able to implement our `Overview` screen yet so this is something that can be implemented. 
On our `Detailed View` screen, we could expand the size of the `Impact Of Features Over Time on Happiness Score` charts and add in a scroll bar to improve user experience. We also have not made it so that a user can only select 10 countries on this view. This would ensure that the dashboard serves its purpose and the user is able to clearly differentiate between multiple trends as opposed to being inundated with too much data. We also have not added in the ability to filter by regions as well as countries. We could also do some minor formatting (i.e. moving the titles so that they are centered and adding properly formatted axes labels) that could ensure that our dashboard is more aligned with our designs. If we have time, it might also prove fruitful to add in more effective and aesthetically pleasing error messages. It is worth noting that we changed some minor design aspects to improve usability (i.e. having a search field for countries to add instead of a scroll bar).

### Limitations and areas for improvement:

At a macro level, to better understand what causes happiness, one thing that could be done to improve this is understanding correlations between various factors. This would involve adding to the backend to make this possible and setting up additional screens or charts to display this.

On a micro level, we could try and figure out new designs that would improve the aesthetic layout of the graph so that it is less crowded and easier for the user to identify trends with a higher degree of fidelity.
