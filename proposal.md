# HappyDash

## Motivation and Purpose

Role: Data science team at an intergovernmental agency <br>
Target audience: Politicians/Decision makers in government

As the world has experienced a very difficult 2020, it becomes ever more important that governments look after the mental well being of their citizens. Looking at annual reports gives a snapshot of the current state of each country - but seeing trends over time and between countries is a valuable addition. With our app, we hope to allow for exploration of the trends in happiness reports by country/region/continent over time to evaluate changes needed in public policy.

## Dataset Description

The description we will be working with is an aggregate of five years worth of data from the [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/) (WHR). The data spans from 2015 - 2019 inclusive. As part of the annual surveys - the WHR has modelled the average happiness score (from 1-10) as a sum of 6 key variables.

These are:
- Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
- Life Expectancy
- Generosity 
- Social Support
- Freedom
- Corruption Levels

The modelling methodology for arriving at this contributions can be found in the statistical appendix [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/happiness-report/2019/WHR19_Ch2A_Appendix1.pdf).

We will be accessing a collection of the reports from Kaggle to show trends over time. The raw data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness).
